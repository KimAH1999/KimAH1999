### Hi there 👋,

### My name is Kimberly Aguilar Hermoso (she/her/hers), and I am a Junior Full Stack Web Developer and I got my certificate of completion with UCSD Bootcamp Extension via online. ​👨‍💻​👩‍💻​ I am currently looking for a position in either Frontend or Backend. By the end on 2023, I will recieve a Computer Info Science Certificate from San Diego Mesa Community College.

#### My overall experience is to much to express when starting my education to now, but it came with the combination of stress, persistence, and confidence. Being born with a Learning Disabilty, was of course my own challenge, but I decided to use it as my strength instead. My Auditory Processing Disorder with correlation with Dyslexia, is a neurological-based processing disorder that impacts an individual's ability to process, store, or produce information. This impacts one's ability to to read, write, spell, and computer or reason. Also, a co-occuring challenge with organization, focus, listening, comprehension, socail skills, motor skills or a combination of these. The way I shifted my destiny is by understanding how to learn and listen to retain the information correctly. My solution was to create a notebook with all the lanuages I learned with additional detailed notes to come back to if needed. Any instruction(task)'s given must be written down to limit confusion/miscommunications. This limits unwanted outcomes and helps to create a more detailed and wanted website for the outcome/output. I immediatly write down and confirm tasks to limit any miscommunications, if it isn't handed to me. By time, group projects, practice, and experiences in the bootcamp made the trick to make it all flow in my brain better. The repetition that I needed to succeed made it easier to understand how to read code and get better in my googling skills.
