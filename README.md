### Hello there, I'm Kim ðŸ‘‹

The UCSD Bootcamp Extension is how I obtained my certification. I want to improve my general front-end and back-end abilities and continue growing myself. By the end of Spring 2023, I will also have a Computer Programming certificate and GED from San Diego Mesa College.
