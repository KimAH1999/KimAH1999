### Hi there 👋,

### My name is Kimberly(she/her/hers), and I am a Junior Full Stack Web Developer and I got my certificate with [UCSD Bootcamp Extension](https://bootcamp.extension.ucsd.edu/coding/) via online. ​👨‍💻​👩‍💻​ I am searching for a position that fits me and helps me grow, either Frontend or Backend. I will also recieve a certificate of Computer Programming at [San Diego Mesa College](https://www.sdmesa.edu/academics/v2/programs/computer-information-sciences/degree-requirements.shtml) by the end of Fall of this year.
