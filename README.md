### Hi there 👋,

### My name is Kimberly Aguilar Hermoso (she/her/hers), and I am a Junior Full Stack Web Developer and I got my certificate of completion with UCSD Bootcamp Extension via online. ​👨‍💻​👩‍💻​🚫​🏢​

#### My overall experience is to much to express, but it came with the combination of stress, persistence, and confidence. I recall the first month on learning the starting code languages and it was actually hard to understand, but now when looking back and getting used to the repetition of seeing it each week and understanding how other languages tie well together with it made it easier by time. Even when I got stuck with each unexpected error, I gained the persistence and motivation and tell myself, "I MUST, I CAN, AND I WILL" or "YOU BREAK IT, YOU FIX IT, YOU OVERCOME IT!"  These words helped me push during those days I wanted to give up or felt the anger want to build up. The good thing is that this Bootcamp gifted me with an excellent Professor and TA that understood how to easily communicate the information to us clearly. They were there anytime, and so was the extra support tutors that were available to us 24/7. Having all this support was another reason that I didn't have an excuse to give up or fail. The class was amazing, and everyone was so nice and supportive of each other that It brought some good people together in the end. As a team, we all knew our end goal and helped each other to help ourselves to understand everything better. Me having a Specific Learning Disability, didn't stop me, and if anything I finished my assignments sooner and the time extra I was given, I went back and studied my basics again and re-did the three assignments I didn't do well on.  

#### Now, looking for a career to grow with 🕵️‍♀️
